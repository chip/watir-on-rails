Description:
    The Watir generator creates stubs for new Watir tests.

    The generator takes a test scenario as its argument.  The scenario name
    may be given in CamelCase or under_score and should not be suffixed with
    '_test.rb'.

    The generator creates a Rails Test::Unit::TestCase in test/watir, mixing
    in the WatirOnRails module.

Example:
    ./script/generate watir SuccessfulLogin

    This will create a SuccessfulLoginTest in:
        test/watir/successful_login_test.rb
