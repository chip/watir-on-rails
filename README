Use this plugin to run Watir tests in Rails.

Watir (Web Application Testing in Ruby) supports Internet Explorer, with Safari
and Firefox ports in development.  Watir boasts a dead simple setup and an
intuitive API for driving browsers programatically.  Visit
http://wtr.rubyforge.org/ for more information.


Dependencies
============

If you're running Windows, you'll need to
  gem install watir

If you're fortunate enough to be on OS X, you can
  gem install safariwatir


Installation
============

You have probably already done this, but just in case...
  script/plugin install svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/watir-on-rails

For version compatible with Rails 2.3.2 (provided by Chip Castle <chip@chipcastle.com>):
  script/plugin install git://github.com/chip/watir-on-rails.git 

Generating Tests
================

You can use the generator to create skeleton Watir tests in test/watir
  script/generate watir Login


Running Tests
=============

Watir tests can be executed by running
  rake test:watir
You'll need to have a test server running.


Decorating Watir with a DSL
===========================

Similar to Rails Integration Tests, WatirOnRails provides developers with the
means to add singleton methods to the browser instance, allowing for the
development of a site-specific language.  The WatirOnRails open_browser method
is mixed into the TestCases generated by Watir.  This method will return an
instance of a Watir browser.  Similar to Rails IntegrationTest's open_session,
it takes an optional block, yielding the browser instance.  A simple
WatirOnRails test method might look like this...

  def test_login
    browser = open_browser
    browser.goto("/login")
    browser.text_field(:name, "user[name]").set("dave")
    browser.password(:name, "user[password]").set("test")
    browser.button(:index, 1).click
    assert_select "div#banner", /Welcome Dave/
  end

...while a slightly more advanced WatirOnRails test method using a site-
specific language might look like this...

  def test_login	
    browser = open_browser
    browser.login_with :username => "dave", :password => "test"
    assert_select "div#banner", /Welcome Dave/
  end

  def open_browser
    super do |browser|
      def browser.login_with(args)
        goto("/login")
        text_field(:name, "user[name]").set(args[:username])
        password(:name, "user[password]").set(args[:password])
        button(:name, "login").click
      end      
    end
  end
